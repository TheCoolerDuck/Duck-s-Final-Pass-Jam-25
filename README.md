---Quantized Luminosity Post Effect---
This folder contains assets for a Standard Render Pipeline scene in Unity.

---Contents---
* Post-processing effect that quantizes luminosity.
* View controller for moving the camera during play mode.
* C# script to render the post effect.
* Banana Man model (created by Banana Yellow Games) for testing.

---How to Use---
1. Attach the Test1.cs script to your camera. (Ignore any initial errors.)
2. Assign NewImageEffectShader.shader to the shader field in Test1.cs.

---Troubleshooting---
If the effect isnâ€™t working:
1. Ensure Unity is using the Standard Render Pipeline (No render pipeline should be selected in Edit > Project Settings > Graphics).
2. Verify that Test1.cs is attached to a camera.
3. This was designed for Unity 2022.3.21f1 try using this version if issues arise. (Other versions may work, but this is the tested one.)
